# Terminal Sudoku
Sudoku for an assignment from my University's Java Programming Course.

Modes: mark, unmark, viewmark and enter.
- mark places a hidden number where you want to place a number inside a cell
- unmark removes the hidden number from cell
- viewmark views the marks placed in a cell
- enter places number in cell

by August Ho (most of the code came with help from rajko)
